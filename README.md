With a background in marketing and literature, I have always had a keen interest in languages and communication. Not only human-to-human communication, but also how we evolve and interact through the technologies around us. After interacting with numerous customer service chatbots, I decided to dive deeper into the phenomena by conducting a masters thesis on the topic. The thesis analysed the advantages and disadvantages of using chatbots rather than humans when communicating with customers, and how the interactions impact consumers' emotional response to the brand. 

After many years of wondering about how systems in my environment work under the hood, and exploring solving problems through code, I have now decided to move forward by pursuing a career in software development. I love solving problems. At Makers Academy, I am gaining the skills that will enable me to design and build the technologies that power the world of tomorrow. I am seeking a junior software engineering role - I am eager to contribute towards building impactful technologies, while growing and learning from more experienced developers and engineers.

## Skills

### Effective Task Prioritisation

As a graduate student at Stockholm University, I managed to successfully balance my full time studies, while assisting the marketing department at The LEGO Group (2-3 days a week). I also had a very busy schedule with our marketing focused student association.

At first, I made the mistake of accepting too many tasks and responsibilities at once. The goal was to make the most out of my experience and make sure there were no missed opportunities for growth, learning and networking. However, I soon realised that just completing tasks in order of the most urgent deadline, or in order of arrival, was not the best approach.

Taking a step-back to organise, reorganise and continuously adjust to the very dynamic situation made me adapt at balancing various simultaneous projects and requests. This is the prioritisation method that I used, and continue to use, in order to not fall behind on my goals:
* keeping a list of all my tasks;
* understanding the goals;
* estimating the time and effort needed to complete each task;
* highlighting different levels of urgency while being realistic;
* avoiding distractions

The experience did not only teach me the best ways of prioritising tasks when everything seems important, it also made me aware of when and how to productively collaborate with my teammates and colleagues to get the right things done. In the end, I managed to successfully complete my course work, landed two marketing briefs for my student association, while efficiently full-filling my part-time role at LEGO.

#### Problem Solving 

In a previous marketing job, I once oversaw an active campaign that, despite following all the tried and proven best practices for social media ads, was delivering a lower than expected profit. I carefully reviewed the brief, the quality of the ad, and its various settings. Then I realised that the problem was not with the ad itself, but with parts of the landing page that did not meet the standards for optimal conversion rates at the time. The performance of the campaign significantly improved once the land page was amended by the client.

Although making changes to the land page was outside the scope of my role, discovering this issue helped me develop an open-minded approach to problem solving. I learned not to overly rely on my initial hypothesis, but instead search for possibilities that I had not originally taken into account. This skill continues to prove very useful when reading coding error messages, and while brainstorming ways of solving development related issues.
